# Pneumonia-detection

This dataset contains images of x-rays with pneumonia infections and without. The task of the following neural network is to classify pneumonia infections correctly. The dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. If you want to test this project by yourself, it will make sense to download this dataset to your local machine. After downloading modify your ROOT_DIR to the correct path and make sure that the project structure ist equal to the following:

dataset
train
test
val
checkpoints
checkpoint
After that you can start training. My personal high score was an accuracy of 0.95 and a loss of 0.12 after just a few minutes of training :-)
